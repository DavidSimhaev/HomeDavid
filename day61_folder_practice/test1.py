g = """Hello, Dear Pearsonvue. I arrived at the address of the testing center, and it turned out that the address was incorrect. I notify you that the branch under the address "Jerusalem Bethlehem Hebron Street Sbaih Complex" is not actual. I tried to contact the phone number that was indicated on the information form, to which I was answered by a person who did not know English or the local language well, but I still managed to make some kind of communication with the representative, but again there was no specific address. The city is indicated, but there is no actual address. The man told me, when arriving in the city, contact the local people, ask how to get to your destination, since Google Maps does not have information about this address, to which the local people had no idea where this destination is. As proof, I ask senior managers to check the authenticity of this data. 
In this regard, I ask for the opportunity to take the exam in another branch on the territory of the Israel."""
